# Methodology

For this project the Design Thinking methodology with the Flipkit toolkit was chosen, due to how relevant our final users' experience and opinions are. It's expected to have multiple iterations through the development process and many prototypes.

## Work In Progress notice

Some documentation might be in spanish but not yet translated to english or vice-versa, when the development is completed it will get fully translated to both languages.
