# TODO in api module

- [x] make things more modular, right now there's a lot of copy-paste code, the functions in charge to deal with this will be created in crud.py

- Documentate the API (swagger UI with YAML probably, when the project is done the API will be re-done following [this article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/building-rest-apis-using-flask-restplus-sqlalchemy-marshmallow-cff76b202bfb))

- Implement pagination (most likely when doing the graphQL implementation)
